## Topic and Argument

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Review Processes represent a key site of public engagement with science. Approximately 500 of these processes a year result in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that documents the positive and negative environmental impacts of proposed projects, including impacts to endangered species, air and water quality, historic and cultural sites, and social and economic conditions. As such, EISs require the integration of expert analysis from a range of scientific domains including geology, atmospheric science, ecology, hydrology, and toxicology. In addition to serving as a decision-making tool for federal agencies, EISs provide detailed information about project impacts to key stakeholders, including businesses, advocacy groups, and affected citizens. 

While TC scholars have examined public engagement with science in the context of environmental assessment and decision making (Simmons, 2008; Blythe, Grabill, & Riley, 2007; Jones et al, 2012; Card, 2020) recent efforts to “modernize” public participation in regulatory decision making in concert with the emergence of new media have transformed how domain experts, regulators, and invested citizens create and interact with these sites of scientific and technical communication. To be sure, citizens may still find and read a physical copy of project documents before standing in line at a public library or city hall to voice concerns during their allotted three minutes at the microphone, but as we illustrate in this article, scientists and regulators increasingly engage citizens and other stakeholders via virtual reality reading rooms, GIS-driven interactive digital documents, and digital models and simulations.

In this article, we provide a tour of the ecology of emerging digital tools and artifacts that increasingly mediate public engagement with science in the context of environmental decision making. In so doing, we shed light on how emerging digital technologies are being used to facilitate 1) collaboration among scientists and other technical experts and 2) engagement with citizen stakeholders. As our examination of emerging technologies in this context illustrates, while not all technical communication is science communication, science communication is increasingly also productively viewed as technical communication. We conclude by discussing implications for the relationship between technological literacies, civic action, and sociotechnical deliberation.  

## Webtext Structure & Design

Given the nature of our project, we plan to include a number of multimodal elements. While some of the artifacts we analyze could be linked too directly (e.g. interactive, GIS-based reports or a virtual reality reading room), the authors of these artifacts tend to remove them upon project completion. As such, we intend to record and embed videos in which we interact with those artifacts and make use of screenshots to call attention to salient elements.

We plan to design our webtext in the open source scientific and technical publishing system Quarto. Doing so will allow us to emulate a number of strategies used in the artifacts we analyze (e.g. granular, topical structure; integration of multimodal elements; single-source creation of alternative output formats). In addition, it will allow us to leverage built-in accessible design functionality.

Butts and Jones explore how environmental communicators can draw upon the rhetorical elements of place to help people understand complex problems. They share lessons learned from designing EcoTour, a multimedia environmental advocacy project. They are interested in how traditional maps can be augmented with emerging technologies to help create more democratic discourse in environmental communication.

This study explored the usability of digitalized public-facing documents (specifically ESRI StoryMaps and web solutions) in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process. The usability test conducted in this study showed disparities between the experience of younger and older digital report users, creating highly variable levels of engagement and satisfaction. This work argues for continuing attention to be paid to this emerging genre (e.g., usability testing, development of best practice guidelines) to make important  information more accessible.

This paper highlights the potential of advanced digital technologies for improving environmental assessments (EA) but also underscores the existing gap between the potential benefits and the current level of adoption among practitioners. It emphasizes the need for training and addressing concerns to promote the effective use of digital tools in EA. This work is valuable for its review of the application of digital approaches in EA. By focusing on the perception of practitioners, this work contributes to a better understanding of how these approaches might be useful and beneficial in terms of enhancing the quality and effectiveness of EA.
